# what is IQ-test

IQ or Intelligence Quotient is a standard score that shows how far above or below, his/her peer group an individual stands in mental ability. The peer group score is an IQ of 100. The IQ number is attained by giving the same test to huge numbers of people from all socio-economic strata of society and then taking the average. 

# our IQ-test

We tried to design an IQ test with 30 questions that gives you a score after answering all the questions and measures your IQ between 85 and 130.

# UI/Ux

By designing a minimal appearance for the site and placing the icons in the right place, we have created a wonderful site for you that you can share this site with your friends and measure your IQs.
